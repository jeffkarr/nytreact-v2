# New York Times Article Search application. 

This application enables users to search for and save articles of interest from a prominent news website. Articles that are saved are stored in a MongoDB database. Users can also delete their saved articles from the database.   

This application uses the React.js framework along with Node.js and Express.js making it a full stack application. 

##Setup Instructions:
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The app uses several npm packages. To install these packages, navigate to your project folder and type:

```yarn install```

Please refer to the README generated with the Create React App for instructions on deploying the game to GitHub pages. 

This project is very useful because it gave the developer experience working with the front-end React framework along with the Node and Express back-end frameworks.  

Currently, only the original developer maintains and contributes to this project.
